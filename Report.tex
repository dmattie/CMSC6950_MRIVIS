There might come a time in the future where you may find yourself with a file 
that is a scan of your brain.  It's a Nifti file, and you may think 
\textit{\textbf{"Hey, wouldn't it be nifti if I could see my brain?".}}  Well, it would!  But then 
you start to wonder how that 
could be possible, and whether Microsoft Paint can read that file format.  You 
discover that it can't.  Now we have a solution.  Here is a tool that will take 
your brain and collapse it into a single PDF for your viewing pleasure.

This is a collage of different levels of a T1 Structural MRI

This is a "carpet" to condense and represent a high density 4D nifti file
