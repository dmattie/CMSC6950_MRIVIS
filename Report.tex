I'm cheating a bit here buy not sourcing my example data from the internet.  Nifti files are big, and I have to send to the moon and back to get it (satellite internet).

This is a collage of different levels of a T1 Structural MRI

This is a "carpet" to condense and represent a high density 4D nifti file
